# Why Recursion
- It helps in solving bigger/complex problems in a simple way.
- You can convert recursion solution to iteration and vice-versa.
- Space complexity is not constant because of recursive calls.
- It helps us to break down bigger problems into smaller problems.

# How to understand and approach a problem
- Identify if you can break down problem into smaller problems.
- Write the recurrence relation if needed.
- Draw the recursion tree.
- About the tree
   - See the flow of functions ,how they are getting in stack.
   - Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls.
   - Draw the tree and pointer again and again using pen and paper.
   - Use a debugger to see the flow 
- See how the values and what types of values(int,string,e.tc.) are returned at each step,See where the function call will come out.In the end ,you will come out of the function.
